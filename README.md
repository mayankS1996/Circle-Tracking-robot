# Circle-Tracking-robot
The repository contains code for an old circle tracking bot with obstacle avoidance.It was created in my spare time during my second year as a learning experience.The codes shown may have small bugs since the final version had not been saved so an earlier version of the codes have been uploaded.I decided to upload the codes here so that it may be useful for others attempting similar projects.
