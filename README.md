# Circle-Tracking-robot
The repository contains code for an old circle tracking bot with obstacle avoidance.It was created in my spare time during my second year as a learning experience.The codes shown may have small bugs since the final version had not been saved so I have uploaded an earlier version of the codes.I decided to upload the codes here so that it may be useful for others attempting similar projects.
